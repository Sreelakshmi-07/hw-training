- Meeting conducted 
	Advised to remove def task_examine(self,task_success) , global task variable
	Explained several function flaws, the distinction between local and global variables
	The self argument, and the difference between the functions for producing lists before and after a function.
	Notable alterations that occurred:
		1. def employee(self, emp_name, emp_id):

       			 self.task_list = []

		2.  def end_task(self, task_success):

        		self.task_success = task_success
        		end = datetime.now()

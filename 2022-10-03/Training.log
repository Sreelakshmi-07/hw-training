	- Web scraping using APIs
		- APIs follow an extremely standardized set of rules to produce information.
		- Methods
			There are four ways to request information from a web server via HTTP:

			1. GET
			2. POST
			3. PUT
			4. DELETE
		- Authentication
			Although some APIs do not use any authentication to operate many modern APIs require some type of authentication before they can be used
			Charge money per API call, or service on some sort of a monthly subscription basis. Others authenticate  “rate limit” users (restrict them to a certain number of calls per second, hour, or day), or to restrict the access of certain kinds of information or types of API calls for some users. 	
			All methods of API authentication generally revolve around the use of a token of some sort, which is passed to the web server with each API call made.
			eg : token = "<your api key>"
			     webRequest = urllib.request.Request("http://myapi.com", headers={"token":token})
			     html = urlopen(webRequest)

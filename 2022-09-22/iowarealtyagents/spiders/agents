  "description": "I have had a passion for the real estate industry in various capacities for a very long time. It all started with an Architectural Drafting course that I took many years ago. The final goal was to make blueprints for my dream home. I still have the blueprints and look at them from time to time.With every opportunity I would study home designs and floor plans in home building magazines. I always imagined myself in the home building industry at some point in my future.For 5 years I had the opportunity to work with a well-respected home renovator. I learned many skills, such as installing windows and doors, tiling, grouting, hanging drywall, mudding and sanding, painting interiors and exteriors, installing baseboards and trim and much more. I did start my own interior painting business and named it Wall Polish.Because of my experience in home renovations, I branched out to being educated as a Real Estate Investor. As a result of this education I am still an investor in rental property and am able to do my own repairs. My business name is House Hunters.I was also a technical writer for a large window and door manufacturer. Then I was asked to be an Office Lean Analyst for the same company for which I earned my certification.I knew my next venture would be as a Realtor. I studied for my real estate license, joined Iowa Realty and am now a buyer's and seller's agent. Also, with my years of knowledge and experience as a real estate investor, this allows me to be able to work with other investors who are seeking and selling properties to help grow investment portfolios.   Because I have an interest in existing, as well as new home construction, it will be my pleasure to help you find the home of your dreams, as well as the location and builder of your choice for new home construction.Since 1977 my other passion is showing and breeding Great Danes. I have enjoyed many successes and have numerous clients world-wide. They too have shown the beautiful Great Danes I sent to them to top awards. My hard work and dedication to this wonderful breed has paid off tenfold and the friendships I made through the years are invaluable. Because of my experience in housing numerous dogs, I know what other canine fanciers are looking for in a home that offers a dog friendly environment. Another area of my expertise!",

I work closely with my manager Kristina Sharp (a real estate rockstar!) and enjoy the networking ability the Altoona office gives me to often learn about properties before they ever hit the market!Prior to joining Iowa Realty I worked in many areas of education from daycare to preschool, to special-education preschool (my personal favorite!), to afterschool programs both in Des Moines and Chicago, IL (my hometown!). I loved building connections with families wherever I worked. At my heart, I am still an educator. Real estate can be overwhelming and at times confusing to navigate. Through it all, you want you and your family's dreams and assets protected. That's what I do! I firmly believe that knowledge is power, and I view my role as a counselor and guide in the process, equipping you with understanding and tools to be a truly empowered home buyer.My commitment to you is that during our transaction together1) I will take the time to explain all options in a way that you can feel confident you have understood.2) You will receive quick responses by the communication method that works best for you.3) I will provide you with charts, analytics and facts about the current market so that you are well informed.When you choose to work with me you are choosing an agent who will be with you every step of the way.Let's find your dream home together!",

My experience and familiarity with Tucson has made me an expert in all areas of the city and surrounding neighborhoods.In my free time I love to watch movies and read. They are great ways to unwind and keep a clear head. This is the same reason that I love to take walks and go on hikes with my family. I am a huge animal lover, especially dogs; I have a beautiful dog that is part of my family. My husband is a contractor and I have helped him with his business in my free time; because of this, I have learned a lot about building and remodeling which is a skill that goes hand in hand with my passion for interior design.Family is the most important part of my life. I have four grown sons and 10 grandchildren. When my kids were young I chose to work in the educational system and help children with special needs learn to read. The hours were great so I was able to be with my family. I also owned a paint company for a while. 21 years ago I earned my Real Estate License. When I got started in real estate I joined my mother who had a long career in real estate. Starting with my mother taught me a lot, and I have used that knowledge to continue my career in real estate even after her retirement.As a mother of four boys I have developed great listening, multitasking, and negotiating skills. I have honed these skills and applied them to my business in real estate. I will listen to all of your concerns, questions, and suggestions. I will negotiate the best contract for you. I am very patient, so you can be assured that I will not make rash decisions while representing you. I love to meet new people, and many of my client relationships have continued past our transaction. I look forward to working with you and having you join my real estate family.",

  "description": "I am a Des Moines native. I am proud of Des Moines and all the surrounding communities for offering a great quality of life.   l love listing and selling homes! I was first licensed in 1981 and began my career at Iowa Realty. During that time I helped anyone including;   First time home buyers-many had very little money but I found a way they could be homeowners;   Families relocating for their job who were totally unfamiliar with the Des Moines area;   Many who moved to a larger home & had a home to sell;   I worked with several homebuilders marketing and selling their new homes.   Then in 1998 my husband & I went on an adventure to Phoenix, Arizona. I stayed in the Real Estate arena but worked with a title company for 7 years. We decided it would be benificial for me to get licensed again and help Frank. Because I was licensed I could do everything from paperwork to showing properties to guiding sellers in the best way to have their homes sell quickly and for the most amount of money. We had formed a team!   In June 2019 we returned to Des Moines and once again I took the Real Estate License test! I am able to help people buy & sell in my home town again!   I take everyone who desires to be a home owner seriously. It is my job and I am committed to do my best to help them achieve that goal. I am a problem solver and work until I find a solution!

Home buying can be hectic and stressful. Believe me I know. Our first home buying experience did not go too well and I took action and am now a Realtor due to that situation.

  "description": "I am originally from Iowa and grew up in a small town called Belmond. After high school, I went to several colleges including University of South Dakota, Kansas State University, and graduated from Arizona State University with my Bachelor's Degree in Family Studies. After returning to Iowa, I began my career with Hubbell Homes as a community manager in May of 2004. In this position, I learned an immense amount of knowledge including new construction and sales/marketing. In 2009, I became a licensed real estate agent with Iowa Realty. I absolutely love my job! I truly enjoy helping clients find their next home and helping them prepare their home to sell. I have listed and sold homes in all areas including West Des Moines, Indianola, Altoona, Van Meter, Ankeny, etc. I have two children, Grace age 14, and Gavin age 13, that keep me busy with all their activities. I also have 2 dogs and have a passion for animals. Please let me help you find your next home or sell your current home! Thanks so much!",

We started our married life in Pella, Iowa and throughout our marriage we have moved several times. The moves have consisted of moving several hours away and simply across town. With all of our moving experiences, several years ago I decided to become a Realtor. I like to help my clients navigate the process by listening to their needs, concerns and putting them first. My hope is to help families large or small have the least amount of stress and anxiety when it comes to buying or selling your home.To me home is not a place, it is a feeling. I have found that when you find the right place you get a feeling and you envision memories being made. You can see yourself finding your independence in your first home, a place where you can raise your children or a home that you want to enjoy your retirement in. No matter what stage of life you are in I would be honored to help you find your next home.",

  "description": "After going to school for building trades and spending time in the construction industry, I started my own moving business in 2016 and built it from the ground up. It was a wonderful experience and I gained a ton of business and customer service experience, but ultimately I wasn't in love with the industry. I sold the business in 2020 to another local entrepreneur with the hopes of keeping the brand I built alive.Fast forward one year, and I decided to dive into real estate. My passion for customer service and knowledge of residential construction, which led me into real estate, helps me provide 5-star service. I look forward to helping you buy or sell your home and make the process as easy and streamlined as possible.When I'm not working, I'm out hiking, bird watching, or playing with my three-year-old labradoodle Mia at the dog park. Feel free to reach out via email or phone today to discuss anything real estate related!",

  "description": "Sales and Marketing have always been my line of work dating back to selling ice cream at Baskin Robbins when I was 15! I have to say I was a pretty good Cookie Monster cake designer. I graduated from Iowa State with a BBA in Marketing and have always enjoyed the many aspects of Sales & Marketing:  meeting people from a variety of backgrounds; getting to know people & what is important to them; helping people in times of joy and in times of sadness to try to make it as smooth as possible.  helping people prepare their homes; working with them to limit their expenses but maximizing their $s in the needed repairs or improvements; working as a team to assist sellers in hiring local contractors they can trust; hiring a stager when appropriate; listing homes with professional pictures & descriptions of your home & utilitiizing the marketing powers of the Iowa Realty Brand which includes but is not limited to Zillow, Trulia, social media, etc.  I do my best to be available as my clients need me. I answer my phone, reply to emails and texts on a timely basis. I care. I listen. I strive to Exceed Your Expectations.  : This can be stressful, but I do my best to make it smooth and even enjoyable. I know the real estate business and am not in the business for a quick sale. I am in the business because I truly care about people and want to make sure they are well-taken care of throughout the process   after the closing. I understand the importance of negotiations, and I want to make sure my clients are treated with respect and in a professional manner. I have worked with many agents over the years, and I have found that other agents appreciate my professionalism and commitment to being organized and ensuring the transaction is handled in a timely basis. I want to ensure my clients are satisfied and go out of my way to make sure they are treated well and with the respect they deserve. Plus, I continue to help my clients AFTER they have moved. I am happy to help answer those questions like.....a good painter, a good oil change, a landscaper, a babysitter, a good salad....if I don't have an answer, I will do my best to find out for you!  My business has grown over the years. I have sold many people multiple homes. I have helped their friends, their family and their co-workers. This is how my business has grown. Word of mouth that I care, and I want what is best for my clients. I don't try to be the biggest, but I do try to offer the best service to my clients. I have found that by being honest, hardworking, knowledgeable and truly caring, my clients come back and refer others. So, thank YOU to all of you who have referred me over the years!  I have lived in Indianola most of my life. I enjoy our size. Not too big and not too small. We provide the opportunities that most communities need and desire: Strong schools: 4 Elementaries (including Year Round Option), Class 4A (we are big enough to offer lots of opportunities, but small enough that participation is possible) AP classes, local shopping, community pride, downtown square, green space, bike trails, Lake Ahquabi, Pickard Park, Simpson College in the heart of our town, Wineries, YMCA, National Balloon Classic, Indianola Parks & Rec, Warren County Fair, Des Moines Metro Opera, and so much more! I do my best to be supportive of our community through volunteerism and financial support. And BTW, our proximity to Des Moines is a pleasant surprise: 15 minutes to the Des Moines International Airport, 25 minutes to Downtown Des Moines, 25 minutes to Jordan Creek Mall...plus we have a pleasant drive with lots of green space & the convenient by-pass!  I don't have a big advertising budget to pay other companies for leads. I don't hire out of state firms to boost my website when someone types realtor into their google search. Instead, I value my clients and in turn, put my marketing dollars into organizations and events that benefit our town and residents. Over the years, I have built a strong business in Indianola. In fact, about 80% of my business is in Indianola (I also help clients throughout Warren County and the Metro like Des Moines, Ankeny, Urbandale, Clive, West Des Moines, Altoona, Pleasant Hill, Johnston, Bondurant, Granger too, in case you are wondering). In turn, I invest in Indianola with my time, knowledge, marketing experience and monetary support. I believe in belonging to the Indianola Chamber, supporting our schools and local events. I have volunteered on boards and committees ranging from Preschool to Church and Elementary School, Middle School & High School to Events such as marketing and sponsorships for Indianola RABGRAI 2019. I have also been part of several projects to help others arranging meals, sending cards of support to those in need, Co-Chairing our annual Operation Christmas (serves over 500 kids and 200 families each year). While enduring the pandemic, it became very evident that supporting local was more important than ever. I have made it a priority to support local restaurants and shops by leading a gift card challenge, meals, and creating & sponsoring It Pays to Do Homework for our kids doing school at home, which benefits local non-profits like Kiya Koda, Park Friends, Indianola YMCA, The Helping Hand, Heal House of Iowa & Indianola Dollars for Scholars, . I truly believe that by supporting local, we all benefit. With my clients trusting me over the years with their real estate needs, I am further committed to Making a Difference in the lives of people in our town.  , I realized local non-profits were needed more than ever and yet weren't able to hold fundraisers & events as in the past. That is when it started my #itpaystosupportlocal program. When a client buys or sells a home with me, I donate $100 in their honor to a local non-profit of their choice. So far here are some of the non-profits who have benefited: The Helping Hand, Heal House of Iowa, Kiya Koda, Indianola Hope Foundation, Des Moines Metro Opera, Indianola Music Boosters, Indianola YMCA, IMPACT, Indianola Balloon Museum, Indianola First United Methodist Church, Whittier PTO, Indianola Balloon Classic, Irving PTO, Food Bank of Iowa, Shoot for a Cure: Cystic Fibrosis, The Move Project, Imagine the Possibilities, Alpha Womens Center, Life Serve Blood Center, Norwalk Area Food Pantry, Des Moines Mutual Aid Bail Fund to name a few.....I truly believe when we care about our community, we all benefit.  Family:Husband, Todd, works for the State of Iowa DNR (30+ years) & is an avid outdoorsman. We have 2 children. Kate received her Masters in Public Administration, and worked for a Non-Profit helping families in need in Colorado. In April 2021, she and her fiance, Erik moved to Minnesota in the midst of the pandemic. They married in Sept 2021 & are both enjoying Minnesota. Kate works for a nonprofit focused on homelessness, while Erik is a CPA working remotely. They enjoy hiking, reading & cooking in their free time. Plus, they love her black lab Josie! Jackson graduated Iowa State majoring in Business/Entrepreneurship. He enjoys living in Ames and being a DU fraternity member. He has spent summers selling waffles at events, driving the Outside Scoop ice cream truck to events, and running a painting crew and interned at the Papa John Center in the CyStarter program.

Go figure! Todd and I enjoy spending time with our kids whenever we can. We are fortunate to have most family nearby. I also enjoy my classes at the Y and am fortunate to have a wonderful group of friends that have supported each other over many years as we faced many stages from pregnancy to diapers to school to college & now Empty nesters!

  "description": "I am a wife, mother, grandmother, volunteer and Realtor. It is my goal to make the home buying/selling process as fun and easy as possible. Other people may measure success in financial terms, but finding you the right home within a budget is a puzzle I enjoy solving. If you don't like aggressive salespeople, I'm the agent for you. If you are interested in listing your current home, I can help you to price it, stage it and get it SOLD! My success is measured by your happiness. I love helping people! Each client has unique requirements and I try to help my clients succeed in their goals while at the same time dealing with the realities of the market. I work with people in a way that honors their needs and personal style. I also ask a lot of questions to zero in on your priorities. I'm in this business for the long haul and I work hard to establish long term relationships with my clients. Knowing the market, and continually educating yourself are important in my business. I'm proud to say that I am a Certified Residential Specialist. Only 4% of all realtors achieve that goal. Call or email me today!",

  "description": "As a lifelong resident of Des Moines and Ankeny, Jenifer has seen a great deal of growth and change in our community. She went from having an actual cornfield behind her back yard to living in the fastest-growing city in the midwest, without even having to move! Today, the Des Moines area boasts world-class restaurants and entertainment, while being the top of everyone's best city to... (invest, startup, raise children, retire). But no matter how things change, our midwestern values of kindness, consideration, authenticity, and honesty remain. The Des Moines area is truly a great place to make your home.   When Jenifer isn't selling real estate or studying for her next designation, she can usually be found attending concerts or drum corps shows with her friends, or visiting her kids at college. If you ask very nicely, she might even sing some opera for you. Here's what she has to say about her sales philosophy:It's important to listen to what clients tell you verbally, but look at what they are telling you with their expression as well. I had a client who was asking me to show her ordinary, sensible properties because that's what everyone told her she should do. But she looked so bored. It wasn't until I took her to a home that had some architectural variety that she showed some more enthusiasm. Homes with unusual features or historic character can be intimidating, but I helped her find the right professionals to consult and she was able to buy with confidence. I love helping people follow their heart while still using their brain.If you are looking for an experienced professional you can trust to guide you through the biggest purchase of your life, and wouldn't mind going to some concerts afterward with a new friend, I'd love to work with you!About Jenifer:Real Estate Broker AssociateAnkeny NativeHomes sold in Des Moines, Carlisle, Granger, Ankeny, Altoona, Polk City, Waukee, Baxter, Adel, Downtown, Pleasant Hill, etc.Acreages, Single Family, Townhomes, Condos, Fixer-Uppers, Investors, etc.Drake AlumDrum Corps AlumMom of ThreeTeacher: Music, Special Ed, ESL, TAG",

I'm here to help reduce the stressful part and make sure this time of growth and change is an exciting one for my clients.I grew up in a small town in northeast Iowa and the work ethic and commitment to your neighbors that I was taught growing up has stuck with me. In fact, I started my real estate career in that small town and I've sold a number of houses in the Des Moines area to people who have moved here from back home.My client satisfaction speaks for itself, with over 75% of my current business being referral and/or return business. After 20 years of selling real estate, the most rewarding part of my job is the connection I'm able to make with my clients. I genuinely care about the people I serve and it's important to me to develop relationships founded in trust.Real estate is not just my job, it's my passion. You deserve to have your real estate needs met with patience and professionalism, and I wouldn't have it any other way.Since 2004 during my time with Iowa Realty, I've earned the following honors and recognitions:2015, 2016, 2017 & 2018 Achievement awards for over 3 million in sales.2017 DMARR circle of excellence award for selling over 50 homes.2017 Incentive trip award to Naples FL for over 7 million in sales.Since 2018 I've been an agent mentor to new real estate agents.",

I can't emphasize enough the importance of working with an experienced and highly trained Realtor! As you're well aware, a home is generally your largest investment you'll make. While I'm proud of the real estate industry and of my fellow Realtors for the past 48 years, it's important for you to understand that all agents are not created equal!   If you are interviewing or considering other agents, ask if the agent sells real estate full time. Also ask what designations they hold-it shows their commitment to continuing education and career development.   Professional Resume:My philosophy for the past forty eight years is to treat everyone I work with as if they were a member of my own family.   If my credentials meet your expectations for providing the level of service you expect and deserve, please feel free to call me at 515-991-6914 or email me at   . My website is  .

  "description": "You hate typical real estate agent bios. I do too. They're stiff, bland, and identical to every other bio out there. Instead of boasting ad about awards and accomplishments you're not interested in, I'm taking the novel approach of actually giving you what you want -- real answers to questions you're probably wondering right now.Q: Will you return my calls and emails?Yes. Without question. I realize this is one of the major frustrations the general public has with dealing with agents. I get dozens of calls and emails daily, and I work hard to reply as quickly as possible.Q: I've met many Realtors who are jerks. Are you a jerk?Depends on who you ask. If you ask certain agents who have stood between my clients and their real estate goals, they'll probably say yes. A handful of people think I leave golden footprints in the sand. Those are the two extremes, and most people's opinion falls somewhere in the middle.   Here's what I can tell you: I'm honest and candid. I take pride in being approachable and friendly. And if you need a quick real estate brain, or a strong dose of honesty, you're in the right place. Loyalty to family, clients, and friends is one of my core values. Want to really find out if I'm a jerk? Mess with one of those people.Q: Do you have experience doing exactly what I need?Until you tell me what you need, there is no way of knowing - but here are some specialties of mine. If your goal or situation isn't represented on this list, don't worry. Contact me anyway. If I can't help, I'll refer you to another agent who can.·First Time Homebuyers·New Construction·Move-Up & Downsizing Buyers·Resale Listings In All Price RangesQ: What are you really good at?On a personal level, I'm a pretty good cook and have been known to get rounds of applause when I'm on a karaoke stage. On a professional level, here are the skill sets that I've developed over the years:·Listening. Unfortunately, it's a lost art these days.·Patience. Also a lost art. Buying and selling homes can be confusing - I do it everyday, you don't. Let me walk you through the process·Conflict Resolution. Many real estate transactions go smoothly, many do not. Let me put out the fires while you worry about packing.Q: What do clients think of you?My clients are better suited to answer this for you. I've got lots of testimonials posted on Zillow and Iowa Realty's website for you to read.Quick Snapshot:·Full-Time Realtor since 2005·Multi-Million Dollar Producer·Multi-Year Achievement Award Winner",

I bring superior skills in communication, negotiation and conflict resolution to every situation to facilitate win-win results. And my personal knowledge of home construction projects-having been through the process-provides added value to families interested In custom projects.When I'm not working, I love spending time with family and friends.

  "description": "Hi, my name is Randy Kramer. I have been a resident of the Des Moines metro area for 30 years. I currently reside in the downtown area but have lived all around the Des Moines area. I graduated from high school in Pocahontas, Iowa; attended Central College in Pella, Iowa for my undergraduate studies; and I procured my Juris Doctorate from the University of Iowa College of Law.    I have been a practicing attorney in Iowa for 30 years with Nationwide Insurance where l led a team of attorneys, paralegals, and support staff. I retired from Nationwide decided to procure my real estate license. As an attorney, I have developed and retain the ability to quickly read people and negotiate matters. These skills have been invaluable in real estate also.    I believe in the need to give back and have been active in charitable organizations all my life. I am currently on the board of Children's Cancer Connection which is very rewarding. I am an avid bicyclist and like to hit the trails of central Iowa as often as possible. And although I am a University of Iowa graduate, I have a sweet spot for Cyclone athletics. As my friends hear me often say, there is no room in my heart for hate and believe one can support both of these programs. I have a weakness for cars, both vintage and exotic. And I will not turn down a craft beer.    I am a people person and real estate allows me meet all kinds of different people while helping them find that perfect home or property. My goal is find clients exactly what they want. I'll invest the time and effort necessary to do that. That is my promise.",

  "description": "Every day is a new day, every adventure is facinating! The amazing thing is that every hand I shake, family I touch, life I impact, big or small, is something I honor for life. The little things I do each and every day to make another person's life what they had hoped it would be that day, is the most fulfilling thing I do. It is also the most satisfying to my spirit. What I do for you and how it affects your family is very important. What you want or need is most important    A little about myself,    I grew up in Davenport, Ia. I was raised largely by my mother, who worked hard her entire life. I played softball/baseball for a trio of amazing coaches during my school years from elementary through high school. They taught me a level of confidence that i would never had achieved, if not for their support. Secondary schooling at Muscatine Community College, then on to Wichita State University. With a baseball career cut short by injury and not enough speed for the bigs, I moved passionately to music, which took me to places that I wouldn't have seen otherwise. After nine years of music, travel and recording I went on to a predominantly retail career. I spent six years in Arizona as an Insurance agent, before moving back to the metro Des Moines area.    I have been blessed 4 kids and 6 grand children that help round out my life. They are the core of my existence. They are amazing, talented, and smart. Not much more that i could ask for",

  "description": "I would first and foremost like to thank you for taking the time to read my profile. I greatly appreciate your consideration and interest in me. I take my dedication to my clients very seriously.I would like to start by introducing myself. In a nutshell I am a hard-working farm kid from the northern pine forests of Minnesota and the red dirt backroads of Texas. I am the fourth of nine Children. My days growing up were spent driving tractors, bailing hay, milking cows, riding horses, tending the garden and being self-sufficient. My father worked in construction and restored classic cars, both of which we were often his crew. My Mom is the best cook in the ENTIRE world and did a lot of cooking, canning, making bread, cheese, butter, sewing, quilting, and knitting.After High School, I joined the Army as a mechanic serving with the Minnesota Army National Guard. I am always grateful for the lessons I learned, the work ethic it instilled in me, the people and points of view I have been introduced to. I served eight years in the Guard as well as a tour overseas as Battalion maintenance for the 1-125 Field Artillery. In support of Operation New Dawn and the U.S. Forces draw down out of Iraq.I have lived a little bit of everywhere, but most of what has shaped me has been a combination my time spent on the farm, Texas, and the Army.I met My husband Eric while deployed overseas and we have been a remarkable team ever since! We have four amazing, smart, adorable, and hilarious kids who constantly keep our lives interesting. I should really write a book about all the stories you just can't make up that they have added to our lives!I enjoy taking my kids to State parks to explore, going fishing, running, anything outdoors, sledding, Ice skating. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the snow! But hate being cold. We go to Big Creek State Park beach often in the summer and spend quite a bit of time on our deck and in the back yard grilling and making smores.My goal as your agent is to be the subject matter expert and your personal go to source for all questions or concerns regarding the home listing or buying process. I want to give each client knowledge and understanding, guiding them in making informed decisions.I am continually humbled and honored when an individual or a family makes the decision to entrust me with the incredibly important job of helping them find their new home or list their current home. I consider it to be myprivilegeto be the one selected to guide my clients through the ending of a chapter in their lives and the opening of a new chapter!Every home move has some bittersweet sadness and delight related to saying goodbyeto the past and welcoming in a new future, whether you are downsizing, upgrading, welcoming in a new baby, starting a new job, or starting your retirement, every home holds and shares your memories.Whatever you are aspiring to achieve whether listing your home, or searching for a new home, my goal is to understand, listen, and use my expertise and experience to make your dreams a reality.I do not pretend to know everything, and I never will, but there is nothing I cannot learn,be taughtor, teach myself, once I put my mind to it. I like to try to remain a sponge and soak up the valuable knowledge I can from not only my colleagues but each client and experience I encounter along the way.Personally, for me, there is no greater joy in this profession then watching someone walking into a home for the first time and witness their entire face light up when they realize THIS! THIS IS THE ONE!Please reach out to me at any time with any Real Estate needs you may have.Thank you for your time and consideration.",

  "description": "I have been in the real estate industry my entire career. Starting with a degree in Real Estate Finance from The University of Northern Iowa, I then worked for an outdoor advertising company (billboards) in Des Moines for six years at Real Estate Representative, Assistant Real Estate Manager and lastly Real Estate Manager. That is when my husband and I decided to start a family and move back to our roots of Eastern Iowa. I then began helping my Aunt and Uncle, Dan and Kathy Kaestner, with their real estate business. The work and hours continued to grow with their team and in March 2016 I became a licensed agent. In December 2017 I decided to branch out on my own with my real estate career with Iowa Realty. I live west of Cedar Rapids with my husband and our three children. We stay busy between work, kids' activities, volunteering in our community, and home improvement projects, if there is any time left!",

  "description": "Born and raised in Iowa, I have spent most of my life in Des Moines. I married my high school crush in 1991 and we moved to the beautiful state of Hawaii. It truly was life in paradise.But when the time came to talk about raising a family we both knew Iowa was the place to be. So, we came home to Iowa - to family- and raised two beautiful humans that I couldn't be more proud of. I was a stay at home mom for fifteen years raising our kids and loved every minute of it! But Real Estate was always in the back of my mind and I knew when the time was right, I would pursue my dream of becoming a Realtor. Well, that dream has become reality! With the support of my husband and children I have started my career in Real Estate.    I am ready to use my determination, commitment, dedication and passion to become an advocate and champion for my clients. Using the resources I have at hand and my resourceful nature, I want to help clients find their dream house and make it a home where their dreams come true also. I want to build solid, long lasting   with my clients. A friendship that begins at that first meeting and continues in trust through the entire process of buying or selling a home - and beyond. That   is not over at closing. I am there for them for their future needs and someday the needs of their families and friends.    When I am not working diligently for my client-families, I enjoy spending time with my actual family. I like quiet nights watching movies with my husband most. However, if our two dogs are awake, I can't count on quiet. :) I love reading and even working on some of my own writing. Taking weekend jaunts with my husband to search antique shops for that one special item that I just have to have always equals a good time. I have enjoyed my life and I have some good stories to tell, but now I am excited for the next chapter and all of the stories it will generate. I look forward to meeting new and interesting people and hearing their stories and helping them make new ones.    http://app.iowarealty.com/christine",

Following Senator Harkin's retirement I wanted an opportunity that would not only allow me to capitalize on my skills and experience but would allow me to continue to serve Iowans. It is important for people to have access to safe, decent and affordable housing. Unfortunately, buying a home isn't always easy and it requires a serious amount of time and money. In 2015 I received my real estate license and now I am a licensed Realtor affiliated with Iowa Realty.    My experience and background gives me a clear understanding of the importance of prompt professional service and clear honest communication. If you are a buyer, I am with you every step of the way from pre-approval, to home search, through negotiations, and finally a successful closing. If you are a seller, I will help you accurately price your home, prepare it for market, negotiate with a buyer, and arrive at successful closing.    Whether you are buying your first home, your vacation home, or your retirement home, it is a significant milestone in your life. It's likely to be one of your biggest financial commitment, as well as a strong commitment to your future and overall quality of life. Nothing is more gratifying than helping someone realize their dream of home ownership and I look forward to working with you on all your housing needs.",

  "description": "Hello!   I was born in Cedar Rapids and raised across Iowa until 2001 when my family moved out of state.Eastern Iowa has always felt like home, so I moved back shortly after graduating from Millard West High School. I have over 20 years of customer service experience from working in various industriesfrom my firstjobas acashier at a grocery store, tobars/restaurants,call centers, and a little factory work.Wherever the location, I have always loved working with the public and meeting new people. Real estate always interested me, even as a child moving around, but I never thought of it as a career until my husband got his license. After watching and assisting him for about a year,I found myself begging to be more involved, so he put me in touch with his broker. Real estate is something that we are still extremely passionate about and enjoy doing together.Following mygraduationfrom Iowa Realty University,  I continueto gain knowledge and experience in this forever changing industry. In 2019 I received my Short Sale, Foreclosure, and REO (SFR) designation as part of my continuing education. The beautiful thing about this business is that you can make it your own. We consider ourselves full service and aren't afraid to help with or tackle any project that may come with buying/selling. We have a wonderful photographer, Beth, that we use for all of our listings and access to a variety of trades people who take customer service just as seriously as we do. When you buy/sell with us you get 2 people dedicated to making your dreams come true! My husband, Alec, and I met in our hometown of Olin, Iowawhere we are raising our 3 wonderful boys. We love sports and being outdoors with friends and family. I am an active School Board member, involved with the athletic boosters, am part of the Scholarship Committee through Cedar Rapids Area Association of Realtors, and recently joined the Anamosa Archey Committee. Real estate has offered the flexibility I had been longing for and has been a wonderful fit for our active family!! Whether you are buying your first home, selling your tenth house, moving up or downsizing - I look forward to helping you make your dreams a reality!",

I've come to understand that while computers may give my customers an edge, they can't begin to replace the human aspect of the business. The listening...the caring...the understanding.Whether you're buying or selling a home, relocating or just looking for some honest answers, you'll find that I have a sincere interest in helping you. I've built my business on the concept of high touch, and to me that means being available to my clients, armed with the information they need and equipped with the kind of integrity on which they can rely.There is a human element present in each and every real estate transaction. It's not all just contracts, negotiations, offers and counter-offers. Good agents recognize the emotional needs of buyers and sellers and work to satisfy those desire. This is just as important as the financial particulars.When you work with me, you can be assured I will take the time to get to know you, as a person and as a family, and that I'll address all that you hope to accomplish, professionally and personally.HIGH TECH - It's another dimension of my ability to serve you.HIGH TOUCH - It's the heart and soul of what I do for you.",

  "description": "Hello Iowa!I believe an introduction is in order. My name is Tiffany Junge and I am one of the new Real Estate Agents at the Iowa Realty Beaverdale office. I moved here in June of 2019 and immediately fell in love with the amazing people, long sunsets over the country fields and endless amount of   that Iowa has to offer -- not to mention the endless supply of award winning   and   that are right next to those trails all throughout the state! After purchasing my home, I realized how great of an investment individuals and families can make for their future. Building a better future can be anything from purchasing a home for a long term retirement plan or future college fund, collecting rental properties for passive income or gaining appreciation on a first home to afford the forever dream home. Whatever the goal may be, I will be there every step of the way helping to work towards financial stability, freedom and success. My dedication to my clients does not stop at the closing, it continues until they have achieved their end goal.",

  "description": "We get it. Trying to decide which Realtor to work with feels a lot like dating - it can be fun, but more often than not it's exhausting and you just want to find the right one and settle down.    That's where we come in.    We've got a different approach than most, & we've found our customers appreciate it. We know that buying a home is a stressful life event & won't try to convince you otherwise...BUT we also know it can be fun, exciting, & educational! You shouldn't feel like you need to know everything about buying a home - why would you? We'll be with you every step of the way, one step at a time.    Here's some answers to questions you haven't even asked yet (see how we anticipate your needs?):    Q: Am I going to be able to reach you?    A: Absolutely! One of our biggest pet peeves is lack of communication so we make sure to answer our phones (kind of a novel concept these days!) & return texts & emails promptly. If you've got questions, you can trust that we're going to get you the answers you need.    Q: How many homes have you sold? How long have you been in the business?    A: This one always makes us smile because honestly there are brand new Realtors who are fantastic, and there are some who have been around for years who don't have a clue what they're doing & provide terrible service. But to answer your question, Julie has been selling homes since 2005 & worked in residential property management before that. Suzy started in real estate in 2011 & has a background in accounting. We've helped hundreds of clients over those years find their dream home. A large portion of our business is repeat customers & referrals, which we take great pride in.    Q: Okay, you guys sound great. Are you really like this or just faking it?    A: I guess you'll have to judge for yourself when we meet! We can tell you that we're widely respected & liked within the Realtor community for being great to work with. You can Google us and find lots of reviews from past clients as well.    We sell a lot of new construction - ask us about KRM Custom Homes & Tanzanite Homes! - as well as resale homes in all price ranges. We help buyers & sellers in all situations, around the metro. And we'd love to help YOU with your next move!",

  "description": "As one of Iowa Realty's top performing Realtors, thank you for taking the time to visit our website. I became a licensed professional in 2006 and since obtaining my real estate license I have received the following designations: CNE, CRS, GRI, RFC, SRS, Certified Relocation Specialist and Brokers License. My dedication to my continuing education is very important to me and will allow me the opportunity to service my clients in the best capacity.   I was raised on a family farm west of Des Moines in a small town called Earlham. I was taught the values of honesty and integrity as a child and these values guide me daily as I work. In 2001, I moved to Waukee, Iowa and lived in the community for 15 years. In 2018 I had the oppurtunity to buy a piece of family ground that had been in the family since 1854 and I built a new home and moved back to Earlham in 2018. Since being licensed I have sold over 150 million dollars in real estate and have closed over 650 properties. I average over 1 real estate transaction per week currently. My direct and aggressive approach to real estate has propelled me to the top of the pack among my competition and has earned me several awards throughout my real estate career. I promise to represent you with the utmost professionalism and listen to your needs and wants which is sometimes hard to find in today's society. I enjoy helping buyers find the right fit for them with the qualities they are looking for in their new house. I believe in a direct, honest and blunt approach in real estate to get the job done right the first time. I am a no sugar coat kind of guy; however, I do have a lot of compassion for the people I represent. I beliver no matter how big or small the transaction is everyone deserves a good Realtor.   My specialties include, but are not limited to: New Construction, Acreages, Farms, Relocation Clients, Multi-Family/Investment properties, First Time Home Buyers, Estate Sales, 1031 Exchanges and Luxury Home Buyers. One of my favorite things to do for my clients is to help them build a home from ground up. I have sold over 150 custom built homes which includes, but is not limited to, selecting the perfect lot, helping with plans and specs and following the transaction to completion.   My career background has been in sales and retail for over 20 years and brings value to overcoming obstacles during a negotiation that turns into a win for my clients. I love what I do, and nothing makes me happier than to help my clients obtain their dreams in one of the largest transactions they will have in their lifetime. I believe in getting the job done right the first time.   I am never too busy for any referrals and they are the best compliment I can receive.   In addition, I have received the following honors and recognitions:   2010,2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021 Iowa Realty President's Club (Top 25 Agents with Company)2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016. 2017,2018, Des Moines Area Association of Realtors, Circle of Excellence Award Winner2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 Volume Award WinnerMember of the National Association of Realtors (NAR) since 2006Member of the Iowa Association of Realtors (IAR) since 2006Member of the Des Moines Area Association of Realtors (DMAAR) since 2006Major RPAC Contributor 2013, 2014#5 Agent in Jordan Creek Office 2017#12 Agent in Iowa Realty 2017   Top Prospector in Tigerland   Tiger of the Year   Inducted and member of Iowa Realty's Hall of Fame",

  "description": "Allow myself to introduce myself. (Austin Powers)My family has always come first, and today my three grown children live across the country in California, Iowa, and Florida. Since 2007, we have also called Holiday Lake home much of half each year. When I'm not working or enjoying my parents and family, my interests include fishing, skiing, golfing, reading, sudoku/kukuro and preparing gourmet cuisine. My personal why is to help people who don't have enough to eat, which we all know is an ongoing challenge for far too many Iowans.I was born and raised in Des Moines; graduating from Urbandale High School. I then graduated from the University of Northern Iowa with majors in Marketing/Advertising and Public Relations. In 1999, I received an MBA from UNI in Business Administration.My career has focused on sales and management. Careers have included television advertising, telecommunications, and utilities across NE Iowa. Beginning in 1998, I also began assisting in real estate sales, specializing in marketing and advertising, as well as staging and property maintenance of listings and rentals.Since the pandemic, I've returned home to Des Moines, to be closer to family and lifelong friends in the metro area. The best way to help those closest to me is as a full-time Realtor.Of course, I chose Iowa Realty, because nobody in the state of Iowa helps more buyers and sellers each year! Besides that, no other realty company provides full service to their clients as does our Home Services of America family of companies.Please consider my experience in real estate and a lifetime in Sales as your greatest benefit, with Brian Wheeler on your team. Advocating and negotiating for my clients is in my DNA. Also consider my lifetime in marketing/advertising, especially in real estate, as another strategic benefit. Marketing that stands out in the crowded marketplace is quickly becoming necessary once again!As I've always told the parents of young kids I've coached, I can only promise that we will have fun along the way. We will find your perfect next home and sell your home for top dollar; but wouldn't it be even better to enjoy the process?  That is my utmost commitment to you!",

  "description": "My career at Iowa Realty began in 1988, first as the receptionist and then in marketing and relocation. I was very fortunate to be surrounded by some of the best Realtors in the industry whom I've learned a great deal from. In 2006 I acquired my license and hit the ground running. I pride myself on working hard, being a great communicator and explaining every step of a transaction so that each buyer and seller will fully understand the process. I'm knowledgeable on the market and love working with buyers and sellers. My goal is to get you to the finish line without stress and to be pleased with the results.    My husband, Brad, and I have two children, both living in the area. We have been blessed with four granddaughters, Emery, Reagan, Audra, and Maryn. I have a passion for baseball and love the Chicago Cubs. We enjoy traveling with family & friends, even if it's a short weekend trip across Iowa.",

  "description": "I grew up in Winterset about 30 minutes SW of Des Moines. After graduation, I moved to Iowa City to attend the University of Iowa, the life long dream of mine to be an Iowa Hawkeye. Upon completion of my four year degree, I moved back to the Des Moines area and started my first grown up job. I then moved on to a career with Principal Financial Group. After 9 years, I decided to chase my dream of becoming a real estate agent and follow in my father's footsteps. I left Principal in 2005 and joined Iowa Realty. I have been loving every moment of meeting new clients and friends and helping them find their own dreams. I love my career and sharing the excitement of them closing on their new homes!  I have two amazing kids, Autumn and Hunter! Autumn graduated from ISU and started a career at Principal Financial Group. Hunter is attending Simpson College, enjoys hunting and fishing when he is not working or studying. As much as I enjoy the change of seasons....I love SUMMERS, being around water and I save my traveling for winter to try to escape some of our colder days! I love the peacefulness of nature and time to reflect on how blessed I am for my family, friends, health and career.",

  "description": "Client satisfaction is my number one interest If you are looking for an agent that has focused on understanding the differences all our local communities offer, I am who you are looking for. Over the past  23 years I have had listings or represented buyers in nearly every zip code in the 4 county area surrounding Des Moines and West Des Moines.  I have had the responsibility for listing and selling property as valuable as $2.3 Million and as affordable as $60,000.  Over the last  23 years, I have represented several area builders in projects throughout our region. I have participated in delivering over 500 new homes to the market. I understand the builders that  can and will custom build and the ones that say that they will and are actually unable to truly fulfill that request. I have assisted families with custom construction of all types of homes in nearly every price range. I have the listing responsibilities for several area land developments. I can assist you in the research of regional lots available for built to order homes or acreage properties for your own WOW house.   I have been a licensed Realtor since 1999, my professional training in contract negotiation and inventing creative solutions to outside the box ideas have served my clients well. The most impressive point of difference I can provide, is what the agents I have been on deals with will say about my conduct. I have a very positive approach to this business and that translates into a winning position for my clients. I am full time!

  "description": "Shelly is a Realtor for the Largest Real Estate Company in the State of Iowa.    To let you know a little about her successful story, I'll tell you about her.    Shelly lives on an Acreage South of Des Moines near Indianola. Originally from the South side of Des Moines where she went to Lincoln High School and lettered as a Diver on the swim team all 4 years, and made Captain her Senior year. She has traveled throughout the U.S and still comes back to Des Moines to call it her home. The four seasons to get excited about (especially Spring!) is worth being in Iowa. Shelly has two wonderful children and one sweet Granddaughter. She is married to a pretty cool guy that likes his classic cars and motorcycles. During the summer they spend much of their time at car and motorcycle shows visiting with their friends when they aren't in their swimming pool or working. She's also an amazing cook and baker who loves to entertain her friends and family. I almost forgot.... They have the cutest Pomeranian's named Rocky and Tink. How could I forget them? They love everyone!!!    Shelly spent 18 years with an amazing company called the Vermillion Group, where she wore many hats. Back in 1998 she started as a Project Recruiter and within her first year she was the first Project Recruiter in the office to make the highest achievement, Pacesetter status. With that reward she won a trip to Acapulco, Mexico. This was just a start to her successful career. Within her years she worked with all the top Recruiters in the office helping them get to their highest achievements. She has such a great personality and gets along with everyone. After many great years, Mike Vermillion sold the business and Shelly had to find a new path.    Which lead her too.........    Iowa Realty!    After a few years helping her husband manage and sell Smith Body and Paint, her best friend spoke with the Manager at Iowa Realty South Regional office and that was history! What a perfect move for Shelly.    After years of helping people find their career path, now Shelly can help them find their Home.    She was raised by a successful Father that owned a Siding and Window company in Des Moines, her Mother is First Impression's Director with Kum and Go Headquarters, and her Brother builds custom homes in the Des Moines Metro area. In her previous years she also painted homes for a living and has many friends in the construction business. I can honestly say that Shelly knows a lot about the business before she even stepped foot into real estate. Not to mention there isn't an area around town that Shelly can get lost in.    Call, text or email her today and she can help you list your home and/or find the home of your dreams    cell: 515-401-3036",

Let me start off with a little about me, I co-manage our Altoona and Ankeny offices, but also hang my license as a realtor out of our Altoona office(This is also my hometown.) I have resided in central Iowa majority of my life, therefore I have an extensive knowledge of Des Moines and its surrounding areas. This in turn is very beneficial when working with local buyers/sellers. My main goal is to sustain lifelong connections with my clients. I act as an advocate for them, and represent them to the fullest of my capability. I listen to what is important to them, and strive to give the best real estate experience possible. Buying/Selling a home does NOT have to be a stressful, this is a huge life event and should be done with someone you trust. I have access to ample amount of education opportunities, and I also have a large network of real estate relationships/resources including mortgage lenders, inspectors, contractors etc. I will help clients through the FULL process. If you are ready to take the steps of buying/selling a home, I'd love to hear from you. Please feel free to reach out to me via phone, text, email, Facebook, etc. I look forward to making you a LIFELONG client, and helping you find YOUR home sweet home.",

  "description": "I'm a farm boy from North Central Iowa. After serving in the U.S. Army and finishing my degree at Iowa State University, I worked in the Ag Business field providing products and services to farmers in Eastern Iowa. I then transitioned into the finance industry and spent 36 years in small town banking. After retiring, I started a second career in Real Estate as a Realtor in Missouri before moving back to Iowa to be closer to my grandchildren. After getting my Iowa Real Estate License I became associated with Iowa Realty. They are a great company and I really enjoy my career as a Realtor. I enjoy meeting and talking to people. My finance and lending background has been an asset to serving and shepherding my clients through the real estate buying or selling process. I take that responsibility very seriously as their property is one of their largest assets. It is not just a house but is their home. I take pride in assisting people secure the home of their dreams or getting market price when they sell. I pledge to provide you with the excellent service you deserve. I would appreciate the opportunity to meet and talk with you. Thank you for reading this short biography.    Some of my client's comments:    Recently I sold a property in Story City. Roger Severson did an incredible job! He was always very friendly, patient, and thorough. After working with Roger I wouldn't want to work with anyone else. I really wasn't looking forward to the sale process, but he made it feel easier by listening to my needs and following through with excellent communication and actions when needed. I would recommend Roger to anyone.    Roger was great! Made long drives just for us and shared some laughs!    Roger Severson of Iowa Realty did an excellent job.",

  "description": "Real Estate is a great fit for me as I love to meet people and learn about their interesting journeys through life! You might say I live vicariously through the folks I meet and work with! My main goal is to find a great match for you!    Whether you are a first home home buyer or a seasoned investor, I want to take good care of you! For the first time home buyer, I'm so excited to guide & assist you through your major investment. Owning a home is in essence a forced savings account. It also positions you to protect some of your earnings through tax breaks afforded home owners! If you haven't purchased your first home yet, please reach out for information which will help you ready yourself to do so. Whether you are ready to up-size, down-size or right-size, or find another investment property, I will take delight in finding that property for you!    I have been a licensed realtor since 2002 and have spent the entire time with Iowa Realty, although I have spent time in 3 different offices. My start was in the Indianola office where I spent 3.5 years; it was wonderful with great agents and management! With a personal relocation, I needed a closer office to work out of. Waukee was my choice and I spent 5 years there. It was as wonderful as the Indianola office with great agents and management!    One of my goals has always been to make meetings as convenient as possible for my clients. During my career, I had coordinated a lot of client meetings at the Valley West office. So, naturally my eventual relocation was to the Valley West and guess what? I love it as well! It is central and convenient to every suburb and surrounding community I choose to work in. I couldn't ask for more! We have a fantastic team, lenders on staff with flexible hours that can work on your preapproval after hours and an escrow company that can close the loan on closing day!. We can be the one-stop shop for you! Iowa Realty has a phenomial website which is very user friendly and you can search statewide. Actually we have an updated site with too many awesome features for me to mention. Please take time to peruse through it!    All the Best to you and yours!!    Connie",

A little background, I was born and raised in Ottumwa Iowa, where I grew up working alongside my parents at the family business. This huge part of my upbringing was the root of my hardworking and entrepreneurial spirit!After high school I went to the University of Northern Iowa, where I earned a degree in Business Management with a focus on leadership. During my time at Northern Iowa I was very involved with Student Government as well as the Dance Marathon program, raising money for the University of Iowa Children's Hospital!After graduation, I began my real estate career in Ottumwa. I worked there 3 1/2 years and became a top producer in the area, working in both residential and commercial real estate, which allowed me to develop my skills and passion that I utilize to serve my clients in every situation! In 2016 it was a big year for me. I got engaged to an amazing woman and also earned my broker's license! These two things led to talks with Iowa Realty about a move to Des Moines. After just a few discussions, I knew they were the perfect fit to allow me to continue building my skills and giving my clients the best experience possible!I would love to have the opportunity to visit with you about your home search and offer to you my skills and dedication to your home buying experience.",

  "description": "Growing up in a Real Estate family gave Jen a head start on what the life of a Realtor is like. Her parents owned an Iowa Realty Franchise and she can remember visiting her Dad at open house on Sunday while her Mom gave him a report on her behavior at church. This was in the days before lockboxes when Realtors had to pick up house keys at the listing firm's office and Jen loved when agents came to her parent's home office so she could hand the key to the agent. Jen became a licensed Realtor in 2008 while continuing to work full time in higher education. She left her job in higher education and dove into real estate full time in June of 2014 and earned her Broker Associate License in 2015. Jen works with buyers and sellers of all property types and also specializes in assisting clients in the new construction process-from interviewing Builders to the end product! As a Trainer with HomeServices of Iowa, Jen enjoys training, educating, and assisting her colleagues in all aspects of real estate transactions. Jen lives in Ankeny with her husband Greg and is a huge Iowa State fan and enjoys golfing, reading, cooking, shopping, and spending time with friends and family. Little known Jen factoid: She was a three year letter winner in softball while attending Luther College.",

  "description": "I have sold real estate for 36 years. I am married to a wonderful guy Rollie Schenkel and we have 2 daughters and 4 grandchildren. I have owned a real estate company Mississippi Valley Realtors for years but just became tired of owning with all that goes with owning and managing a business. This is a great move for me. I can now devote my time and energy to only listing and selling property which is the part I love. Based on owning and managing real estate companies throughout the years, along with all the property I have sold gives me a great deal of experience that allows me to help you with all your real estate needs.    I have completed most of the Realtor designations out there. That means I have also a great deal of education in the real estate business besides my personal experience.    I am looking forward to a great new chapter in my life and I hope that includes you. Please call, text or email with any of your real estate needs. Also if you have friends or family in need of a good, honest and experienced Realtor please give them my name.    Thank you all.",

I have it a star less as the assembly instructions were not really the best. I did understand them at first glance and was able to assemble within half an hour but i feel it's not really understandable for a lot of other people.. and for the price people pay a little bit of detailed instructions would be much better.."

I really liked it and keep up guys, you guys did a good job in creating a unique chair designed for todays gamers or engineers working from home. Support from them on whatsapp and video call is unexceptional. Just got disappointed by delivery it took 13 days to deliver at 160km distance and this can definitely improved."

In my case, one of the cover panels for left-side mechanism broke in transit & the team were quick to send a replacement asap. Overall I am very satisfied with the quality and the service provided."

It took 40 mins to assemble by myself and once done the chair was super comfortable and feels durable with the metal base. I HAD an issue with the height of the chair as im 6 foot tall hence the company sent me an entire new chair with the corrected height Gaslift which was insane since i used chairs from brands like greensoul monster and Cellbell Transformer series but both had certain defects such as the reclining function or loose armrests. This chair showed none of the issues mentioned above and was extremely comfortable too do mind that the seat has side bolsters that do touch your thighs but the padding more than makes up for it. And since the company is offering 3 years warranty, I have no worries for the future as Kepler Brooks has already shown me their level of customer service which i must say is extremely good. I highly recommend thus chair if your looking for a chair in the 13k price range as others wont have the features or customer service that this chair and brand offers. I really look forward to purchasing more products in the future."

This gaming chair contains neck pillow, lumber back and footrest which is super helpful at times when you have to take power nap. It got wing back mechanism and height adjustability which makes things easier for a tall person to sit comfortably. On the downside, this chair generates massive amount of heat while using it for a prolonged time and the massager didn't serve its purpose well."

The best part for me probably are the hand supports, they are super adjustable and comfortably padded. I don't lean back on a regular basis, but I've tried lying down flat on it and it's super safe. The only way to topple it, I've found is to sit on the front edge and lean forward (and nobody expects you to do that lol)."

I requested them to send red colour which is matching with my chair other wheels but red was not available. So technician sent me all new 5 wheels of other colour which is of superb build quality.

It is not easy to assemble the chair by yourself we have to call the support and they will send and they will force you to give 5 start rating that is really bad I told them I will only give a review after 1 month and here it is."
